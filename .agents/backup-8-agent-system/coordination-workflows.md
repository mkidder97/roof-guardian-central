  fromAgent: string;
  toAgent: string;
  taskId: string;
  context: {
    completedWork: string;
    remainingWork: string;
    constraints: string[];
    dependencies: string[];
  };
  successCriteria: string;
  estimatedTime: number;
  escalationConditions: string[];
}
```

### Status Reporting Protocol
```typescript
interface AgentStatus {
  agentId: string;
  currentTask: string;
  progress: number; // 0-100
  estimatedCompletion: Date;
  blockers: string[];
  requestedSupport: {
    fromAgent?: string;
    reason: string;
    urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  }[];
}
```

## Conflict Resolution Patterns

### Resource Conflicts

### Priority Conflicts
- **Scenario**: Critical bug vs planned feature work vs field emergency
- **Resolution**: Meta Coordination Agent with AI Intelligence for business impact evaluation and priority optimization
- **Escalation**: Human decision for major scope changes with full context and recommendations
- **Field Considerations**: Mobile & Field Agent provides operational impact assessment

### Knowledge Gaps
- **Scenario**: Agent lacks required domain expertise
- **Resolution**: Auto-escalation to appropriate specialist agent with context transfer

- **Domain Mapping**: Clear escalation paths between consolidated agents for seamless knowledge transfer

### Capability Overlaps (New)
- **Scenario**: Multiple agents can handle similar tasks (e.g., data visualization)
- **Resolution**: Meta Coordination Agent evaluates agent workload, specialization match, and success rates
- **Optimization**: Dynamic capability mapping with performance-based agent selection
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement of capability overlap resolution patterns

## Agent Performance Monitoring
