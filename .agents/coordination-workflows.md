# Agent Coordination Workflows

## Multi-Agent Task Orchestration

### 1. New Feature Implementation
```
Workflow: "Implement Real-time Inspection Collaboration"

Phase 1: Analysis & Design (Parallel)
├── Security Agent: Threat modeling and auth requirements
├── Database Agent: Schema design for real-time data
└── Frontend Agent: UI/UX requirements analysis

Phase 2: Core Implementation (Sequential)
├── Database Agent: Create tables, RLS policies, migrations
├── API Agent: Implement WebSocket endpoints and handlers
├── Frontend Agent: Build collaboration UI components
└── Testing Agent: Create test scenarios and data

Phase 3: Integration & Deployment (Parallel)
├── Testing Agent: Run integration and E2E tests
├── DevOps Agent: Prepare deployment pipeline
└── Security Agent: Final security audit

Phase 4: Production Release (Sequential)
├── DevOps Agent: Deploy to staging
├── Testing Agent: Production smoke tests
└── DevOps Agent: Deploy to production

Coordination Rules:
- Phase completion requires all agents to succeed
- Failed agent triggers rollback and re-planning
- Meta Agent monitors progress and optimizes handoffs
```

### 2. Bug Fix Workflow
```
Workflow: "Critical Production Bug Resolution"

Step 1: Triage (5 minutes)
├── Meta Agent: Analyze bug report and assign primary agent
└── DevOps Agent: Implement immediate mitigation if needed

Step 2: Investigation (15 minutes)
├── Primary Agent: Root cause analysis
├── Supporting Agents: Provide context and impact assessment
└── Meta Agent: Coordinate investigation efforts

Step 3: Solution Implementation (30 minutes)
├── Primary Agent: Implement fix
├── Testing Agent: Create regression tests
└── Security Agent: Security impact review (if applicable)

Step 4: Validation & Deployment (15 minutes)
├── Testing Agent: Validate fix in staging
├── DevOps Agent: Deploy to production
└── Meta Agent: Monitor fix effectiveness

Escalation Rules:
- >60 minutes total → Human intervention required
- Security implications → Security Agent takes lead
- Data corruption risk → Database Agent takes lead
```

### 3. Performance Optimization Workflow
```
Workflow: "System Performance Optimization"

Step 1: Performance Analysis (Parallel)
├── Database Agent: Query performance analysis
├── Frontend Agent: Component render performance
├── API Agent: Function execution times
└── DevOps Agent: Infrastructure metrics

Step 2: Optimization Planning
├── Meta Agent: Prioritize optimizations by impact
├── All Agents: Create optimization proposals
└── Testing Agent: Define performance benchmarks

Step 3: Implementation (Sequential by Priority)
├── High Impact Optimizations First
├── Medium Impact Optimizations
└── Low Impact Optimizations

Step 4: Validation
├── Testing Agent: Performance regression tests
├── DevOps Agent: Production monitoring setup
└── Meta Agent: Success metrics validation

Coordination Rules:
- Each optimization must show measurable improvement
- Rollback plan required for each change
- Performance degradation triggers immediate rollback
```

## Agent Communication Protocols

### Task Handoff Protocol
```typescript
interface TaskHandoff {
  fromAgent: string;
  toAgent: string;
  taskId: string;
  context: {
    completedWork: string;
    remainingWork: string;
    constraints: string[];
    dependencies: string[];
  };
  successCriteria: string;
  estimatedTime: number;
  escalationConditions: string[];
}
```

### Status Reporting Protocol
```typescript
interface AgentStatus {
  agentId: string;
  currentTask: string;
  progress: number; // 0-100
  estimatedCompletion: Date;
  blockers: string[];
  requestedSupport: {
    fromAgent?: string;
    reason: string;
    urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  }[];
}
```

## Conflict Resolution Patterns

### Resource Conflicts
- **Scenario**: Multiple agents need database access
- **Resolution**: Sequential access queue managed by Meta Agent
- **Fallback**: Parallel development branches with merge coordination

### Priority Conflicts
- **Scenario**: Critical bug vs planned feature work
- **Resolution**: Meta Agent evaluates business impact and reassigns priorities
- **Escalation**: Human decision for major scope changes

### Knowledge Gaps
- **Scenario**: Agent lacks required expertise
- **Resolution**: Auto-escalation to appropriate specialist agent
- **Backup**: Meta Agent provides additional context or creates new specialist

## Agent Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
```typescript
interface AgentPerformanceMetrics {
  taskSuccess: number; // percentage
  avgCompletionTime: number; // minutes
  escalationRate: number; // percentage
  qualityScore: number; // 1-10
  collaborationScore: number; // 1-10
  userSatisfaction: number; // 1-10
}
```

### Alert Conditions
- Task failure rate >20%
- Completion time >150% of estimate
- Multiple escalations for same task type
- Quality score <7/10
- User satisfaction <8/10

## Continuous Improvement Process

### Daily Optimization Cycle
1. **Morning**: Meta Agent analyzes previous day's performance
2. **Midday**: Implement minor optimizations (auto-approved)
3. **Evening**: Prepare improvement proposals for human review
4. **Night**: Deploy approved optimizations during low-traffic

### Weekly Review Process
1. **Monday**: Comprehensive performance review
2. **Tuesday**: Agent capability gap analysis
3. **Wednesday**: Workflow optimization proposals
4. **Thursday**: Testing and validation of improvements
5. **Friday**: Deployment of approved changes

### Monthly Strategic Review
1. Agent specialization effectiveness analysis
2. New agent requirements identification
3. Major workflow redesign proposals
4. Technology stack evolution planning
