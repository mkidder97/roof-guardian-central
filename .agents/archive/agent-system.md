### Meta Agent (Enhanced)
11. **Meta Agent** - Reasoning-enhanced coordination, continuous improvement, cross-domain optimization

## Autonomous Agent System Usage

### 1. Natural Language Prompts
Simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language:

```
"Optimize property loading performance for mobile inspectors"
"Add real-time collaboration to the inspection interface"
"Implement offline photo sync for field operations"
"Create a new campaign automation workflow"
"Fix any performance issues with the map component"
```

### 2. Automatic Agent Coordination
The system automatically:
- **Analyzes your request** using advanced NLP
- **Selects optimal agents** based on current performance and availability
- **Creates execution plans** with proper sequencing and dependencies
- **Executes tasks autonomously** without human intervention
- **Monitors progress** and resolves conflicts automatically
- **Deploys results** after quality validation
- **Reports completion** with performance metrics

### 2. Agent Invocation Commands

#### Enhanced Agent Commands
**Core Infrastructure Agents:**
- `/database-agent [task]` - Geospatial queries, inspection analytics, schema optimization
- `/frontend-agent [task]` - Mobile-first UI, offline PWA, real-time collaboration
- `/api-agent [task]` - Edge functions, n8n integration, external APIs
- `/testing-agent [task]` - Field testing, E2E workflows, quality assurance
- `/devops-agent [task]` - Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure scaling
- `/security-agent [task]` - Multi-tenant security, compliance, audit trails

**RoofMind Domain Specialists:**
- `/n8n-agent [task]` - Workflow automation, campaign orchestration
- `/ai-intelligence-agent [task]` - Predictive analytics, computer vision, ML models
- `/field-operations-agent [task]` - Route optimization, safety protocols, equipment
- `/business-intelligence-agent [task]` - ROI analysis, executive dashboards, market intelligence

**Meta Coordination:**
- `/meta-agent [task]` - Complex multi-agent coordination, reasoning-enhanced optimization

#### Agent Status Commands
- `/agent-status` - View all agent current tasks and performance
- `/agent-metrics` - Performance metrics for all agents
- `/agent-optimize` - Trigger meta-agent optimization review

### 3. Workflow Examples

#### Simple Task (Single Agent)
```
User: /frontend-agent "Fix TypeScript errors in enhanced-camera.tsx"
→ Frontend Agent handles TypeScript resolution
→ Reports success/failure with details
```

#### Complex Task (Multi-Agent)
```
User: /meta-agent "Add offline photo sync capability"
→ Meta Agent coordinates:
  1. Database Agent: Design offline storage schema
  2. API Agent: Create sync endpoints
  3. Frontend Agent: Implement offline UI states
  4. Testing Agent: Create offline scenario tests
  5. DevOps Agent: Deploy with monitoring
  6. Security Agent: Audit sync security
```

#### Performance Issue (Optimization)
```
User: /meta-agent "Property loading is slow in production"
→ Meta Agent analyzes and coordinates:
  1. Database Agent: Query optimization
  2. API Agent: Endpoint performance review
  3. Frontend Agent: Component rendering optimization
  4. DevOps Agent: Infrastructure scaling analysis
```

## Agent Improvement Process

### Automatic Optimization
The Meta Agent continuously monitors all agents and automatically improves:
- Minor prompt clarifications
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation updates
- Metric collection enhancements

### Human-Approved Changes
Major improvements require your approval:
- Significant prompt modifications
- New agent capabilities
- Workflow sequence changes
- Security-related modifications

### Feedback Loop
```
1. Agent performs task
2. Meta Agent evaluates performance
3. Identifies improvement opportunities
4. Proposes optimizations to you
5. Implements approved changes
6. Monitors improvement effectiveness
```

## Configuration Files

## Performance Expectations

### Success Metrics
- **Task Success Rate**: >90% across all agents
- **Completion Time**: Within 150% of estimates
- **Quality Score**: >8/10 average
- **User Satisfaction**: >8/10 average
- **Escalation Rate**: <15% to human intervention

### Response Times
- **Simple Tasks**: 2-5 minutes
- **Medium Tasks**: 10-30 minutes
- **Complex Tasks**: 30-60 minutes
- **Critical Issues**: <15 minutes (with immediate mitigation)

## Best Practices

### Task Description
- Be specific about requirements and constraints
- Include relevant context and background
- Specify success criteria when possible
- Mention any dependencies or blockers

### Agent Selection
- Use specific agents for focused tasks
- Use Meta Agent for complex, multi-step processes
- Use Meta Agent when unsure which agent to use
- Use Meta Agent for performance or optimization issues

### Monitoring
- Check agent status regularly during long tasks
- Review performance metrics weekly
- Provide feedback on agent effectiveness
- Approve optimization proposals promptly

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Production Issue
```bash
/meta-agent "CRITICAL: Production down - [description]"
# Triggers immediate response protocol:
# 1. DevOps Agent: Immediate mitigation
# 2. Relevant Agent: Root cause analysis
# 3. All Agents: Coordinated fix implementation
# 4. Testing Agent: Validation
# 5. DevOps Agent: Deployment and monitoring
```

### Agent System Failure
```bash
/meta-agent "Agent system performance degraded"
# Meta Agent will:
# 1. Analyze all agent performance
# 2. Identify failing components
# 3. Implement immediate fixes
# 4. Escalate to human if needed
```

## Getting Started

1. **Review Agent Capabilities**: Read each agent's `.md` file to understand their expertise
2. **Start Simple**: Try a basic task with a single agent
3. **Use Meta Agent**: For complex tasks or when unsure
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check `/agent-status` regularly
5. **Provide Feedback**: Help agents improve through specific feedback
6. **Approve Optimizations**: Review and approve Meta Agent improvement proposals

This multi-agent system is designed to scale with your project complexity while maintaining high quality and efficiency. The Meta Agent ensures continuous improvement and optimal coordination between all specialists.
