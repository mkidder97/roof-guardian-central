# Agent Coordination System

## Real-Time Agent Communication Hub

This system enables autonomous agent coordination without human intervention.

### Agent Status Tracking
```typescript
interface AgentStatus {
  agentId: string;
  status: 'idle' | 'active' | 'blocked' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  currentTask: string | null;
  progress: number; // 0-100
  estimatedCompletion: Date | null;
  dependencies: string[];
  performance: {
    successRate: number;
    avgCompletionTime: number;
    lastOptimization: Date;
  };
}
```

### Autonomous Task Distribution
The Meta Agent automatically:
1. **Analyzes incoming prompts** using NLP to understand requirements
2. **Selects optimal agents** based on current performance and availability
3. **Creates execution plans** with proper sequencing and dependencies
4. **Monitors progress** and handles conflicts automatically
5. **Optimizes workflows** based on real-time performance data

### Agent Communication Protocols

#### Task Assignment Protocol
```typescript
interface TaskAssignment {
  taskId: string;
  targetAgent: string;
  command: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  dependencies: string[];
  expectedDuration: number;
  successCriteria: string[];
  fallbackStrategy: string;
}
```

#### Progress Reporting Protocol
```typescript
interface ProgressReport {
  taskId: string;
  agentId: string;
  progress: number;
  status: string;
  blockers: string[];
  nextSteps: string[];
  resourceNeeds: string[];
  estimatedCompletion: Date;
}
```

### Automatic Conflict Resolution

#### Resource Conflicts
- **Detection**: Monitor resource usage across all agents
- **Resolution**: Automatic prioritization and queuing
- **Optimization**: Dynamic resource allocation based on priority

#### Dependency Conflicts
- **Detection**: Analyze task dependencies in real-time
- **Resolution**: Automatic re-sequencing and parallel execution
- **Prevention**: Predictive dependency analysis

#### Performance Conflicts
- **Detection**: Monitor agent performance metrics
- **Resolution**: Automatic load balancing and task redistribution
- **Improvement**: Dynamic agent optimization

## Agent Performance Dashboard

### Real-Time Metrics
```typescript
interface SystemMetrics {
  totalTasks: number;
  activeTasks: number;
  completedTasks: number;
  failedTasks: number;
  averageCompletionTime: number;
  systemEfficiency: number;
  agentUtilization: Record<string, number>;
  resourceUsage: {
    cpu: number;
    memory: number;
    network: number;
  };
}
```

### Optimization Algorithms
1. **Task Routing**: Intelligent agent selection based on current performance
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks to prevent agent overload
3. **Predictive Scaling**: Anticipate resource needs and pre-allocate
4. **Performance Tuning**: Continuous optimization based on success metrics

## Autonomous Execution Workflows

### Simple Task Flow
```
User Prompt → Meta Agent Analysis → Agent Selection → Execution → Validation → Completion
```

### Complex Task Flow
```
User Prompt → Meta Agent Analysis → Multi-Agent Coordination → Parallel Execution → 
Integration → Testing → Deployment → Performance Monitoring → Optimization
```

### Emergency Response Flow
```
Critical Issue → Immediate Detection → Auto-Escalation → Emergency Agents → 
Rapid Response → Root Cause Analysis → Prevention Implementation
```
